# SpeechToText_ML_Model
- ## This is a simple Machine Learning model that is based on Supervised Learning where the input is an audio dataset and the labelled output is the word itself
- ## The dataset contains a set of single words said in a bunch of different accents and since we are using supervised learning we split the dataset into training data and test data
- ## We keep training and testing the model until the predictions are on point and accuracy is well above 85 percent.
